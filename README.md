**Project Description: E-Learning Platform for Underprivileged in Bangladesh**

**Objective:** Team Alo's AOOP Lab project aims to provide underprivileged individuals in Bangladesh with an e-learning platform focused on technology education. We leverage object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, including inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and socket programming, to create an accessible and interactive learning experience.

**Key Points:**
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for ease of use with Scene Builder, catering to varying technical backgrounds.
- **Comprehensive Courses:** Diverse technology topics such as programming, digital literacy, and software tools.
- **OOP Integration:** Platform architecture based on OOP principles for modularity and flexibility.
